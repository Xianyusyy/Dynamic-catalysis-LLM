Dynamic Catalytic Literature Extraction
This project aims to develop a robust system for extracting relevant information from scientific literature, with a particular emphasis on catalytic processes and dynamic phenomena. The extracted data can be used for various applications, such as knowledge discovery, research trend analysis, and catalyst design optimization.

Features
Automated literature parsing: The system can automatically parse and extract structured information from scientific publications in various formats (e.g., PDF, XML, HTML).
Named entity recognition (NER): Identify and classify key entities, such as chemical compounds, materials, reactions, and experimental conditions.
Relation extraction: Extract semantic relationships between identified entities, enabling the construction of knowledge graphs.
Dynamic process modeling: Capture and model dynamic aspects of catalytic processes, including reaction kinetics, catalyst deactivation, and process optimization.
Interactive user interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for querying and visualizing the extracted information.
